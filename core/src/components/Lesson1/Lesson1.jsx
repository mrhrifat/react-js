                1.1 What is React
                    

                1.2 How React Works
                    01) Everything in react is a Component
                    02) Component is a small piece of UI. Such as, Like, Comment, Share, Button
                    03) We can resuse component
                    04) We can use it with other component
                    05) We can pass data to it from outside
                    06) It can have it's own data
                    07) It can be styled seperately
                    08) It can be used as many as want
                    09) Relation with one component to another is call component
                
                    10) What inside the Component
                            01) Component has mainly two layer
                                01) Data Layer (It's Dynamic)
                                02) Representation Layer (It's Static)
                    
                    11) We have to work on data layer. All logic goes here & when data layer will changed, the representation layer will automatically changed.

                    12) How can we use multiple components
                        01) Representation layer of a component can render other components


                1.3. Which type of problem react is solving
                
                1.4 Core features of React
                    01) Components

                        01) Props - Data sending
                        02) State - Change own data
                    03) Events
                    04) Conditional renderning
                    05) List & Tables
                    06) Forms & Input elements
                    07) Lifting State Up (Send data child to parent)
                    08) Composition and Component tree
